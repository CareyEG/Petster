<p id="about">The four main things I love doing in life are building things, learning, and making incomplete lists. I have spent my entire career working at tech companies bouncing from positions ranging from accounting to account management to analytics. Most recently I left my position at AWS as project manager to persue my passion in building technology by learning how to code. </p>

Iâ€™ve always loved creating and building new things and coding is a fun new way to do it. Outside of work I enjoy watching movies, cooking, gardening, and exploring the beautiful PNW.</p>
